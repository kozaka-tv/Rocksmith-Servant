Main functions (this is just a raw list now):
- Loads a song from the archive of the user accoring to the playlist request to the Rocksmith (or with the CFSM monitored directory)
- Creates a setlist what is contains the played songs
- Moves a downloaded file (even over LAN) to the CFSM monitored directory and retry it if CFSM does not loaded properly.
